        <h2>What is Blockchain ?</h2>
        <p><strong>Blockchain defined:</strong> In a business network, blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that makes it easier to record transactions and monitor properties. A tangible asset (a home, car, cash, or land) may be intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). On a blockchain network, virtually anything of value can be tracked and exchanged, lowering risk and cutting costs for all parties involved.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why blockchain is important:</strong> Business relies heavily on information. It's preferable if it's received quickly and accurately. Since it offers instant, decentralised, and fully transparent information stored on an immutable database that can only be accessed by permissioned network participants, blockchain is perfect for delivering that information. Orders, transfers, accounts, production, and much more can all be tracked using a blockchain network.<sup id="cite_ref1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup></p>

        <h2>The development of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>The aim of blockchain is to allow for the recording and distribution of digital data without the ability to edit it. Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two academics who sought to develop a system where record timestamps could not be tampered with, first outlined blockchain technology in 1991. But it wasn't until January 2009, almost two decades later, that blockchain received its first real-world use, with the introduction of Bitcoin. 
        <br><br>
        A blockchain is the foundation of the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, described the digital currency as a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party”  in a research paper introducing it<sup id="cite_ref2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin nearly reaches $30,000 via way of means of the end of 2020.</li>
            <li>PayPal proclaims it's going to permit customers to buy, promote and keep cryptocurrencies.</li>
            <li>The Bahamas turns into the world’s first united states to release its important financial institution virtual currency, fittingly referred to as the “Sand Dollar”.</li>        
            <li>Blockchain turns into a key competitor to battle COVID-19, in particular for securely storing scientific studies information and affected person information.<sup id="cite_ref3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup></li>

        <h2>The future for Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Blockchain has visible plenty of media interest withinside the remaining  decades, with organizations speculating approximately what the era should do and wherein it is probably headed withinside the future. With several practical applications for the technology already being applied and explored, blockchain is gradually making a name for itself, mainly thanks to bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
        <br><br>
        Blockchain intends to make business and government operations more efficient, reliable, stable, and cost-effective by eliminating middlemen. When we approach the third decade of blockchain, it's no longer a matter of "if," but rather "when" legacy businesses will accept the technology.<sup id="cite_ref4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup></p>
